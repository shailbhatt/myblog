## What I love

I read the technical books and have curated my youtube and twitter feed in such a way that even during my lazy time also I end up with something amazing in tech news or tips or tutorial. I like to do proof of concept on the new learnings. In this way I learn something quickly. I am little bit methodic person so I do deep dive into the concept to fully understand it before actually using into production.

I love to take part in multiple conferences(like XConf, target-elevate, Linkedin-Conferences, Xdroid, internal amazon conferences) throught out the year to get the direction from mutiple network and forums. 

I explores new field of learning with my current work. Like currently, Apart from comupters, I am learning about Psychology and Equity Trading and Flute.
